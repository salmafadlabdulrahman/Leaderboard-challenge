# Leaderboard-challenge
The leaderboard challenge is a challenge from 30Days of javascript repo, it's about creating a leaderboard for players.

## How it works
it has four input fields, it takes the first name, last name, country and score of the players, and adds the player to the list,
when the player is added, there're three features, you can delete the player from the list, increase the score, decrease the score,
and finally sort the players by their score.
